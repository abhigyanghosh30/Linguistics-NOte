Change in pronunciations: 

-> Regular -  Change of p becoming b in Spanish 
-> Condition - 
-> Phonemic - abstract notion of sounds in a word
	|-> spliting of sounds
	|-> merging of sounds

Neo-Gramarians

Merger of sounds : 2 types - (A,B>B) or (A,B>C)
Splitting of 2 sounds -

Assimilation :
	Progressive : kicked -> /t/

Grimm's law: Rask found similarities b/w Sanskrit, Latin and Greek

	aspirated-> unaspirated -> unaspirated -> fricatives
	voiced      voiced         voiceless      
Eg:	bh       -> b           -> p           -> f
	dh       -> d           -> t           -> Î¸
	gh       -> g           -> k           -> h

Assimilation:
	abcd -> abbd or accd
	
	-different sounds becoming same
	-Eg: chimney> chim(b)ley
Dissimilation:
	accd -> abcd or acbd

	-previously same sound changing into two different sounds
	Eg: 
	- bhabhuva -> babhuva
	- phephuka > pephuka	

Dahl's Law: Applicable for Bantu language
	[-voice][-voice] -> [+voice][-voice]
	Eg:
	- kikuyu -> gikuyu
	- kukua -> gukua
	- kithaka -> githaka

Kinds of Sound Change:

1.Deletions:
	- Syncope
	- Apocope
	- Aphaeresis
	- Epenthesis(insertions)
		- Prothesis
		- Anaptyxis

		- Excrescence
			-insertions in the middle of the word
			eg: amra -> ambra
			    anra -> andra
			    ansa -> antsa
		-Paragoge
			-insertion of vowels at the end of the words
			eg: tat>tata
2. Compensatory Lengthening:
	Eg:
	Mid Indo Aryan	Hindi	Gujrati	Bengali	English
	kampa			k(a~:)p					tongue	
	ganthi			g(a~:)th				knot
	bandha			b(a~:)dh				bond
	sanjha			s(a~:)jh				twilight

3.Rhotacism
Change of s to r
s -> z -> r
It is rare

4. Metathesis:
change in which sounds exchange positions with one another within a word
Eg: Benaras -> Varanasi

5. Haplology:
repeated sequence of sounds is simplified to a single occurrence
Eg: 

6. Breaking:
diphthongisation of a short vowel in particular contexts


Other Frequent Changes:
		1. Final devoicing: devoicing of stops or obstruents word-finally
		2. Intervocalic voicing: sound sbecome voiced between vowels
		3. Nasal Assimilation: nasals to change to agree with the point of 
								articulation of following stops
		4. Palatalisation: Often takes place before or after i and j or before 
								other front vowels, depending on the language, 
								although unconditioned palatalisation can also take place. 
								Two common kinds of changes are called 'palatalisation'. 
								One is the typical change of a velar or alveolar sound to 
								a palato-alveolar sound.In a second kind of change called palatalisation, a consonant
								becomes palatalised by taking palatalisation as a secondary manner of
								articulation, as in eastern dialects of Finnish, where consonants are
								palatalised before i						
		5. Dipthongisation: any change in which an original single vowel
							changes into a sequence of two vowel segments which together occupy
							the nucleus of a single syllable
		6. Monophthongisation:
