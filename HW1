2.2)vowel _m/n_fricative : deletion of m/n
	(VN>V:/_fricative)
	A vowel and the following nasal become a lengthened version of the vowel when followed by a fricative.
	The change doesn't take place when followed by a consonant that was not a fricative.
	
	a->o-
	In 4 & 7 original *an ends up as o- when fllowed by a fricaitive. We can assume that an>a- along with other vowels in the above change.(VN>V:/_fricative)
	When before  a fricative an then subsequently a->o-.
	However some might assuem that the change was rather first an an>0- before a fricative and then the above change applied tothe remaining vowels.
	This is much less likely though not out of the realm of possibility.

2.4)Palatalization: c>cj/_front vowel(e,i)
	(Consonants were palatalized before the front vowels)
	
	v-rounding: front v>round/_cu-
	Front vowels were rounded and turned into corresponding back vowel when followed by a u-
	
	final lax vowels are deleted (apocope)(i-,u-)
	
	remaining lax vowels were lowered (lax v-rounding) (f>e, u->o)
	
	stops became voiceless at the end of the word (final devoicing)
	
2.1)o->u: lengthened mid rounded vowel changes to high rounded
	a>/n_ : 'a' after an 'n' at the word end is dropped after a vowel change
	a->ou: lengthened vowel a- gets dipthingized.
	
2.3)t>ts (Affrication)
	lengthened vowels get dipthingized 
	
	i>I gets laxed
	
	o>u mid rounded vowel becomes high rounded vowel
	
	u>ͻ/_l : u>ͻ if followed by l
	
	p>pf 
	
	hti>ht>ϛt : final vowel preceeded by t is dropped ht>ϛt
	
	g>k, d>t : consonant at word end becomes unvoiced for words beginning with p
