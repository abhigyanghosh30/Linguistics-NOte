---------- CHAPTER 1 -------------------
<<<Intro>>

WHY TO STUDY HISTORICAL LINGO??
 ->	as we determine more accurately what can change and what cannot change in
	a language, and what the permitted versus impossible ways are in which
	languages can change, we contribute significantly to the understanding
	of universal grammar, language typology and human cognition in general
	- fundamental to understanding our very humanity.
 -> it is fun and 

WHAT ISN't HISTORICAL??
 -> History of linguistics
 -> origin of human language
 -> determining or presrving 'pure' forms

HISTORICAL LINGUISTIC - DIACHRONIC (OVER TIME NOT AT THAT INSTANCE)
STUDY OF HISTORY OF SINGLE LANG _ PHILOLOGY
STUDY CHANGES IN DIFFERENT LANG _ COMPARATIVE 

What Is of greater concern to historical linguists is not the etymology of 
these words per se, but the kinds of changes they have undergone and the
techniques or methods we have at our disposal to recover this history.

glamour(initially meant magic etc) from grammar(knowledge, study - magical, astrology)
goodbye < god be with you

the goal is to understand language change in general. For an explanation of
the notions of borrowing, analogy, amalgamation, clipping and sound change

LANGUAGE CHANGES
 -> lexical
 -> grammatical
 -> sound change
 -> borrowing
 -> changes in orthography



---------- CHAPTER 2 -------------------
<<Sound Change>>

TYPES OF SOUND CHANGE ON BASIS OF REGULARITY
 -> Regular
 -> Sporadic(Irregular)

--Irregular--
Sporadic changes affect only one or a few words, and do not apply generally
throughout the language; that is, a change is considered sporadic if we 
cannot predict which words in a language it will affect.
-> speech has lost the r of Old English spra:c
	'language, speech', but r is not lost in spring, sprig, spree.
-> Glamour comes from grammar through the sporadic change of r to l. but
 	graft. grain. grasp adid not change their r to l.

--Regular--
To say that a sound change is regular means that the change takes place 
whenever the sound or sounds which undergo the change are found in the 
circumstances or environments that condition the change.
-> Spanish /p/ went to /b/ in (V_V)

TYPES OF SOUND CHANGE ON BASIS OF CONDITIONALITY
 -> Conditional (spanish /p/ to /b/ in (V_V) only)
 -> Unconditioned (Latin l^j replaced with j in all instances)
 
TYPES OF SOUND CHANGE ON BASIS OF PHONEMES -- PHONEMIC(ALLOPHONE)
 -> Phonemic(alters number of phonemes)
 -> Non-phonemic(same number of phonemes)

Non phonemic uncoditioned
(1) In varieties of English, u> u (central rounded vowel), and in some
dialects even on to y, as in 'shoe' [fu] > [fa], and in some even [fy].
(2) Pipil (o > u)

Non phonemic conditioned
(1) Spanish (n > /ang/) at end

Phonemic(Mergers and splits)
<<Mergers>> 
 - Mergers(A,B > C or A,B > B)
 - Mergers are irreversible (u won't be able to figure out which /a/ came from /o/ and which fom /o/)
 - sanskrit has a < o,e,a of pie (dant < dent)
