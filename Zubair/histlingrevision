Kinds of changes:
 1. Lexical - loss of/change in lexical items 
 	Eg: bewrayeth --> gives you away
 2. Grammatical: Syntax, subject-verb agreement, etc
 	Eg: Came unto him they --> They came to him
 3. Sound
 4. Borrowing
 	Eg: Accent in english, from French
 5. Changes in orthography
	Eg: vnto --> unto

Sound Changes:
 Types:

	Regular or Sporadic
	 - Regularity Principle or Neogrammarian hypothesis: Sound laws suffer no exceptions
	 - sporadic: spraec --> speech as an example; the removal of r is not consistent
	Condition Based vs Unconditional (IMPORTANT: can be applied to all sound changes)
	Phonemic and non Phonemic

 	Non Phonemic Changes:
	 - Non Phonemic Unconditioned
	 - Non Phonemic Conditioned

	Phonemic Changes:
	 - Merger (a,b --> b or a,b-->c)
	 	Eg: Latin American Spanish (/lj/ to /j/)
		    Sanskrit-Latin-PIE (/o/, /e/, /a/ --> /a/)
		
		Merger is irreversible. Merger may be lost.

	 - Split (a --> b,c)
	 	Eg: Historical derivation of mouse, mice, foot, feet FROM mu:s, mu:s-i, fo:t, fo:t-i

	 -- Unconditioned
		MERGER: Eg: Spanish /lj/,/j/ --> /j/ universally in case of latin american spanish
		SPLIT: not given
	 -- Conditioned
	 	Eg: Spanish /p/ --> /b/ in V_V case
		MERGER:
		SPLIT:

	General Sound Changes:
	 - Assimilation:
		Sounds in Relative proximity modify each other.
		Progressive: sound modified follows modifier
		Regressive: sound modified precedes modifier
		Total: Sound becomes identical to another, taking all its phonetic features
		Partial: Sound acquires some traits from other, does not become fully identical to it


	 	Total contact regressive:
		 - Eg: Latin octo --> Italin otto

		Total contact progressive
		 - Eg: PIE *kolnis --> Latin collis
	 	
		Partial contact regressive
		 - Eg: PIE *swep-no --> Latin somnus

		Partial contact progressive
		 - Eg: English spellings with /s/ after preceding voiced non sibilant becomes /z/   
		 
		Distant (non adjacent) 
		 - 

	 - Dissimilation
	 	The opposite of assimilation - sounds become less similar to one another.
		
		: Assimilation is more common than dissimilation
		: Assimilation is usually general and regular, but can be sporadic
		  Dissimilation is usually sporadic, but can be regular
		: Dissimilation usually happens at a distance, though contact diss not uncommon

		Eg: English: chimney --> chim(b)ley
		    
		    Instances of multiple occurences of r in a word are sporadically dissimilated
		    in Romance languages

		    Grassman's law - famous case of regular dissimilation in Greek and Sanskrit 
		    where in roots with 2 aspirated stops, the first dissimilated to an 
		    unanspirated stop

		    .
		    .
		    .

		    Dahl's Law in Bantu

	Kinds of Common Changes:
	 - Deletions:
		Syncope (atata --> atta) 
		- neither initial nor final
		- normally for loss of vowels

		Apocope (tata --> tat)
		- At end
		- usually vowels

		Apheresis (atata --> tata)
	 	- At beginning
		- usually vowel
		- can be regular or sporadic
		- rarely used, people sat initial vowel loss

	 - Epenthesis (Insertions): (asta --> asata)
		Prothesis (tata --> atata)
		- At beginning 
		
		Anaptyctic (VCCV --> VCVCV)
		- extra vowel added between two consonants

		Excrescence (amra --> ambra, anra --> andra, ansa --> antsa)
		- Consonant being inserted between other consonants
		- Usually results in phonetic sequences which are easier to pronounce than the
		  original clusters would be
		
		Paragoge (tat --> tata)
		- At end of word
		- Usually vowel

	 - Compulsory Lengthening: (tast --> ta:t)
	 	Something is lost and another segment, usually vowel, is lengthened

	 - Rhotacism (VsV --> VrV)
	 	Change of s/z --> r

		Usually between vowels or glides

		Some assume change is in form s --> z --> r

	 - Metathesis (asta --> atsa, asata --> atasa)
	 	Transposition of sounds

		Mostly sporadic

	 - Haplology (tatasa --> tasa)
	 	repeated sequence of sounds reduced to single

	 - Breaking
	 	Diphtongisation of short vowel in particular contexts

	 - Other changes:
	 	Final devoicing
		- Devoicing of stops or obstruents word-finally
		- Both word-finally and syllable-finally for Germna, eg.

		Intervocalic voicing
		- vocing sounds between vowels
		- stops in some languages, fricatives in others, all obstruents in others

		Nasal Assimilation
		- np > mp, mt > nt, nk > [ng]k

		Palatalisation
		- before or after i or j or before other front vowels depending on language
		- two kinds of changes
		-- velar/alveolar --> palato-alveolar
		-- consonant takes palatalisation as a secondary manner of articulation

		Diphthongisation
		- single vowel > sequence of two vowel segments occupying nucleus of single syllable

		Monophthongisation
		- Dipthong > Monophtg=hong

		Vowel Raising
		- low vowels > mid or high vowels
		- in particular, long or tense vowels frequently rise
		- can involve wholesale changes, see the Great Vowel Shift

		Vowel Lowering
		- high > mid or low, mid > low
		- Nasalised vowels lowered very frequently
		- vowels are often lowered before uvular and pharyngeal consonants

		Nasalisation
		- vowels become nasalised in environment of nasal consonants

		Lenition (weakening)
		- loose notion
		- somehow weaker articulation
		- examples: stops/affricates > fricatives
			full consonants > glides
			voiceless consonants > voiced

		Strengthening
		- somehow stronger

		Gemination
		- doubling of consonats

		Degemination
		- sequence of identical consonants is reduced to single occurence

		Affrication
		- stop/fricative > affricate

		Spirantisation (fricativisation)
		- stop/affricate > fricative

		Deaffrication
		- affricare > fricative
		- not uncommon change

		Lengthening
		- sound lengthening in some context
		- usuallt vowel

		Shortening
		- shortening of sounds in some contexts

	Relative Chronology:


	Chain shifts:
	 - Push chains
	 - Pull chains
	 - Examples:
		Grimm's Law:
		- Voiced Aspirated Stops --> Voiced Stops --> Voiceless Stops --> Voiceless Fricatives
		  For Germanic Languages from PIE
		  
		The Great Vowel Shift:
 		- Best known Chain Shift
		  long vowels systematically raised, highest long vowels diphtongised
	 		- a --> ae --> 3 --> e --> i --> (ui --> )ai
	 		- aww --> o --> u --> (auw --> )au


Borrowing:
- Loanword - lexical ite not originally part of the vocabulary of the recipient language

- Why do languages borrow from one another
	Need
	- New concept from abroad, need a new concept
	- Eg: coca cola,, automobile

	Prestige
	- Luxury loans
	- Eg: English - pork (french: porc), beef (french: boeuf), cuisine (french: cuisine)
	
	Derogatory
	- Rare
	- eg: hashashin --> assassin

- How do words get borrowed
	Get remodelled to fit phonological and morphological structure of the borrowing language
	Sound changes
	> adaptation or phoneme substitution
	
	Phonological pattern modification
	> accommoddation

	Direct phonological diffusion

- Identifying loanwords and direction of borrowing
	Phonological Clues

	Morphological Complexity

	Clues from cognates

	Geographical and Ecological Clues

	Other semantic clues

- Loand


Analogical Change
- What is it
	Analogical change involves a relation of similarity

	Neogrammarians - Sound change is regular, borrowings need to be identified, and analogy is 
	everything left over

- Types of Analogical Change
	
	Proportional Analogy

	Analogical Levelling

	Analogical Extension

- Relation between Analogy and Sound Change

- Analogical Models

- Other kinds of Analogy
	
	Hypercorrection

	Folk etymology

	Backformation

	Metanalysis

	Blending

Comparative Method:

- Steps
	1. Assemble cognates
	2. Establish sound correspondences
	3. Reconstruct the proto-sound
	   - Directionality
	   - Majority wins
	   - Factoring in features held in common
	   - Economy
	4. Determine the status of similar (partially overlapping) sets
	5. Check the plausibility from perspective of overall phonological inventory of proto
	6. Check plausibility of reconstructed sound from perspective of linguistic universals, typological expectations
	7. Reconstruct individual morphemes

- Indo-European and the Regularity of Sound Change
	Grimm's Law

	Grassman's Law

	Verner's Law

- Basic Assumptions of the Comparative Method
	Proto language was uniform, with no dialect or social variation

	Language splits are sudden
	
	After split of proto language, there is no subsequent contact among related languages

	Sound change is regular


Semantic and Lexical Change
- Traditional COnsiderations:
	Widening

	Narrowing

	Metaphor

	Metonymy

	Synecdoche

	Degeneration

	Elevation (amelioration)

	Taboo replacement and avoidance of obscenity

	Hyperbole

	Litotes

	Semantic shift due to contact

- Attempts to explain

- Other kinds of Lexical changes - new words
	
	Creations from nothing (root creations)

	From personal names

	From place names

	From brand (trade) names

	Acronyms

	Compounding

	Other what

	Amalgamation

	Clipping

	Expressive Creations

	Obsolescence and loss of vocabulary





Pre forms versus Proto forms:
 - Proto : the immediate *reconstructed ancestor of a linguistic branch
 - Pre: (more correctly, the Pre-Proto form) - the non immediate ancestor to a linguistic branch. Ancestor to the proto form

Native words and Borrowed words:
 - Where to draw the line between Native and Borrowed?
 A: Look it up. Current assumption, usage by monolingual speaker.

Code Switching versus Lexical Borrowing:
 Code switching involves a choice between two Languages/varieties/codes, but Lexical Borrowing arises from lack of sufficient vocabulary in a language.
