Kinds of changes:
 1. Lexical
 	Eg: bewrayeth --> gives you away
 2. Grammatical
 	Eg: Came unto him they --> They came to him
 3. Sound
 4. Borrowing
 	Eg: Accent in english, from French
 5. Changes in orthography
	Eg: vnto --> unto

Sound Changes:
 Types:

	Regular or Sporadic
	 - Regularity Principle or Neogrammarian hypothesis: Sound laws suffer no exceptions
	 - sporadic: spraec --> speech as an example; the removal of r is not consistent
	Condition Based
	Phonemic and non Phonemic

 	Non Phonemic Changes:
	 - Non Phonemic Unconditioned
	 - Non Phonemic Conditioned

	Phonemic Changes:
	 - Merger
	 	Eg: Latin American Spanish (/lj/ to /j/)
		    Sanskrit-Latin-PIE (/o/, /e/, /a/ --> /a/)
		
		Merger is irreversible. Merger may be lost.

	 - Split
	 	Eg: Historical derivation of mouse, mice, foot, feet FROM mu:s, mu:s-i, fo:t, fo:t-i

	 - Unconditioned
		Eg: Spanish /lj/ --> /j/ universally in case of latin american spanish
	 - Conditioned
	 	Eg: Spanish /p/ --> /b/ in V_V case

	General Changes:
	 - Assimilation:
		Sounds in Relative proximity modify each other.
		Progressive: sound modified follows modifier
		Regressive: sound modified precedes modifier
		Total: Sound becomes identical to another, taking all its phonetic features
		Partial: Sound acquires some traits from other, does not become fully identical to it


	 	Total contact regressive:
		 - Eg: Latin octo --> Italin otto

		Total contact progressive
		 - Eg: PIE *kolnis --> Latin collis
	 	
		Partial contact regressive
		 - Eg: PIE *swep-no --> Latin somnus

		Partial contact progressive
		 - Eg: English spellings with /s/ after preceding voiced non sibilant becomes /z/   
		 
		Distant (non adjacent) 
		 - 

	 - Dissimilation


	Kinds of Common Changes:
	 - Deletions:
		Syncope
		Apocope
		Apheresis
	 
	 - Epenthesis (Insertions):
		Prothesis
		Anaptyctic
		Excrescence
		Paragoge

	 - Compulsory Lengthening:


 Grimm's Law:
	Voiced Aspirated Stops --> Voiced Stops --> Voiceless Stops --> Voiceless Fricatives
	For Germanic Languages from PIE


 The Great Vowel Shift:
 	Best known Chain Shift
	long vowels systematically raised, highest long vowels diphtongised
	 
	 - a --> ae --> 3 --> e --> i --> (ui --> )ai
	 - aww --> o --> u --> (auw --> )au


Pre forms versus Proto forms:
 - Proto : the immediate *reconstructed ancestor of a linguistic branch
 - Pre: (more correctly, the Pre-Proto form) - the non immediate ancestor to a linguistic branch. Ancestor to the proto form

Native words and Borrowed words:
 - Where to draw the line between Native and Borrowed?
 A: Look it up. Current assumption, usage by monolingual speaker.

Code Switching versus Lexical Borrowing:
 Code switching involves a choice between two Languages/varieties/codes, but Lexical Borrowing arises from lack of sufficient vocabulary in a language.
